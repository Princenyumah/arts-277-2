            more. Every month, our editors and reporters seek the advice of the
            most trusted, experienced, and academically affiliated authorities
            in health, fitness, weight loss, relationships, and more. We also
            keep an eye out for the latest new research in the world’s most
            credible, peer-reviewed academic journals, and distill it for our
            readers in a way that’s practical, accessible, and easy to
            understand. Furthermore, every story in the print edition is
            subjected to a rigorous fact-checking process, in which a team of
            researchers thoroughly vets all factual claims for accuracy. Since
            it launched in 1986, Men’s Health has been nominated for many of the
            publishing industry’s top honors, including 17 National Magazine
            Awards in the categories of personal service and general excellence.
            In 2017, Ad Age named Men’s Health one of its Magazines of the Year.
